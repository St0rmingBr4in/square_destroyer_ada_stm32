This project aim is to create a game running on the \stmdb using Ada and the Ada Drivers Library. The game we implemented is a \mtg.
The principle of a \mtg is to align 3 \sqs of the same color in order to make them disappear.

The player is able to swap some \sqs if the result of the swap makes for a alignment of at least 3 \sqs.
By making alignments the player gains some points. When an alignment of blocks disappear the gravity takes place in order to fill the hole.
If further alignments are created by gravity, those alignments of \sqs disappear, make points to the player and the gravity takes place once again until no other alignments are made.
