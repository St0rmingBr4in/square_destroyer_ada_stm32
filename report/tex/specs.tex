\section{Specifications}

\subsection{System requirements}

The software has a E level criticality.

\subsubsection{Axioms}

\paragraph{The platform}

\begin{itemize}
\item The game will be able to run on a \stmdb.
\item The screen resolution will be $240\times 320$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{The \grid}

\begin{itemize}

\item To comply with the screen ratio, the \grid will be a $6\times 8$ grid.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{The \sqs inside the \grid}

\begin{itemize}
\item The colors of the possible \sqs will be:

\begin{tabular}{ll}

Blue    & \#0000FF \\
Green   & \#00FF00 \\
Red     & \#FF0000 \\
Yellow  & \#FFFF00 \\
Magenta & \#FF00FF \\
Cyan    & \#00FFFF \\

\end{tabular}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{The score}

\begin{itemize}
\item The score will be displayed at the top left of the screen.
\item A combination of 3 aligned \sqs will give \threepts \pts.
\item Each \sq inside a combination will give \sqpts additional \pts.
\item Each combination in a move will increase your multiplier by 1.
\item The multiplier is reset to 1 at each move.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tools}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The compiler used is GNAT version 8.2.1 20181127. Flag used :

            \item -gnatQ: Don't quit. Generate ALI and tree files even if illegalities
            \item -gnatw.X: Disable warnings for No\_Exception\_Propagation
            \item -ffunction-sections: Create a linker section for each function
            \item -fdata-section: create a linker section for each data
            \item -gnatygO: Coding style warning
        \end{itemize}
        In debug mode:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item -O0: No optimization

        \end{itemize}
        In release mod:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item -O3: Optimizations
            \item -gnatp: suppress checks
            \item -gnatn: enable inlining
        \end{itemize}
    \item The development is done on a Linux system Linux 4.20.3-arch1-1-ARCH \#1 SMP

\item The Target platform is a STM32F429I-Disco board.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HLR}

\subsection{Traceability}

This documents describes the specification of our game. The HLR will be listed
with a number, and the LLR referring to them will have the same number and an
additional number separated by a dot.

\subsection{Software Architecture}

\subsection{HLR}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 1. The grid of 8 per 6 squares will be displayed at all time.
    \item 2. The grid will be randomly generated and should not have already
        aligned squares of the same color.
    \item 3. The score will be displayed in the top left corner, unless we are
        in the "Game Over" state.
    \item 4. The user must be able to swap two squares if it provokes an alignment
        of three or more squares of the same color in the grid.
    \item 5. If three or more squares of the same color are aligned, they shall be
        replaced with the blocks directly above them. New colors will be
        generated for the top block when needed.
    \item 6. When a combination is done, the score must increase accordingly to the
        formula described previously.
    \item 7. When no move is possible, the game shall end displaying a message and
        the final score, and then start over.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LLR}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1.1 Draw\_Grid must draw a 8 per 6 grid on the touchscreen of scar of
        39 per 39 pixels.
    \item 2.1 Init\_Grid must generate a random array of Squares.
    \item 2.2 Init\_Grid must generate a grid that has no already existing
        alignment of Squares of the same color.
    \item 3.1 The Run procedure should display the score after updating the grid.
    \item 3.1 The Run procedure should not display the score if the game has
        ended.
    \item 4.1 Is\_Move\_Legal shall indicate if a move provokes an alignment of
        three or more squares of the same color.
    \item 5.1 Is\_Move\_Legal should fill a WorkList of item to process when a
        move is performed.
    \item 5.2 Process\_Move should update the grid accordingly when a move is
        performed making the square "fall".
    \item 5.3 Process\_Move should verify and process if new Combination are
        provoked by the mechanism of "falling".
    \item 6.1 A side effect of Process\_Moves must be the update of the score.
    \item 7.1 Update\_Grid should call Is\_Unsolvable after a move is performed
        to say if a move is available.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Random \sq generator}

\lstinputlisting[numbers=left,firstline=77, lastline=80]{../src/square_destroyer.ads}

\subsubsection{Verification whether a move is legal or not}

The Is$\_$Move$\_$Legal procedure uses the helper procedure Get$\_$Matching$\_$Neighbours which helps in getting all the adjacent \sqs of the same color.

\subsubsection{Helper function: Get$\_$Matching$\_$Neighbours}

\subsection{Tests}

\subsubsection{``Black box'' testing}
Tests were done by flashing the program on multiple boards and testing extensively.
